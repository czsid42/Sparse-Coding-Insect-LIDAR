% This file will train the user defined dictionary by using K-Singular Value Decomposition. This
% is done using only 10% of non-insect images.After training the dictionary the reconstructions 
% of the data is produced by using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. 
% The difference between the original image and the reconstructed image is taken to generate the reconstruction
% error/difference image. This new image is fed to the feature extraction
% algorithm to finish off the preprocessing of data. Due to K-SVD and OMP
% only being able to use type double data the newly generated images and
% their features must be stored back into the original data structure. The
% formattingData.m took the data from the original cell arrays and stacked it to form a single
% matrix of images, the last portion of code reverses this process.
